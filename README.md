## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains **Team DRANZER**’s official submission for the **MathWorks MiniDrone Competition 2025**, featuring a **vision-based flight control and navigation system** for the **Parrot Minidrone**.  

The project integrates **image processing, nonlinear path planning, and autonomous control** using **MATLAB®, Simulink®, and Stateflow®**. It demonstrates a robust **Two-Crown Navigation Algorithm** capable of guiding a drone autonomously through two concentric crown-shaped gates in simulation.

## 🎯 Key Highlights

- ✈️ **Two-Crown Navigation Algorithm** — enables real-time guidance using visual circle detection and centroid tracking.  
- 🔄 **Integrated Nonlinear Path Planner** — modular planners for **X, Y, and Z** trajectories, allowing scalable mission configurations.  
- 🎥 **Vision-Based Control** — combines **Simulink Image Processing** with adaptive gain tuning in control loops.  
- 🧮 **Validated in Simulation** — achieved:
  - **Max Error (MaxE):** 0.24 m  
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.15 m  
  - **Course Length:** 6.5 m  
- 🧠 **Fully Modeled in MATLAB/Simulink** — for control, perception, and state estimation.
